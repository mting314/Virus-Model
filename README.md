# Virus Model

All the many different project files for this little mathematical model that ended up having some interesting components I thought I could share.

 TLDR, the question I aimed to answer was "in a, uh, hypothetical widespead infection that is starting to go international, how long does America have to decide to shut down travel after the arrival of the infection?"

Now as you can probably tell, I started this exploration a really really long time just a bit before things started getting seriously bad here in the US. 

## The PDF
This was the start of the presentation of my exploration, and sort of the most all-encompassing (especially if you care mostly about the math). It goes over the explanation of the main model used, an SIR model I learned in my [mathematical modelling course](https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/courses/math/142), and how I adapted the basic version into one where it could account for the travel between two countries/cities.

## The Jupyter Notebook
Has a Python implementation of the model discussed in the PDF so that we can look at some pretty graphs, as well as have some "experimental" results to confirm the theoretical results from the calculations.
